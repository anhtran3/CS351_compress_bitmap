# CS351_compress_bitmap
Compress bitmap for specific dataset

There is one python file attached: compress_bitmap.py:

To use create_index() and compress_index(), please simply import from compress_bitmap.py and call create_index() or compress_index()

The data.zip contains different dataset to compress with different sizes. You may want to move the input data at the same directory with the output compressed data files. The bitmap and compressed files inside data.zip are input and output after compression.

Also, there is a Write Up and Comparison PDF File that included my analysis
